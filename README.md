1.1.	App report
The aim of this assignment is to create an app that helps the user make a decision on what to eat during their busy daily life still. 
The app is made to be simple to use and should display a choice that is clear to the user. The app is also made to look appealing to the user.

1.2.	App Ui (User Interface)
The Ui of the app contains:
•	2x TextViews 
•	1x EditText 
•	2x Buttons

The first TextView is used to display the title of the app and has no other function.
The second TextView is used to display the output answer which is the suggested meal to a specific time of day. 
The EditText is used to allow the user to input the time of day in their current situation. The first button is used as 
an enter butter that the user clicks after they have entered the time of day the button then runs the back end code which 
then displays the suggested meal in the second TextView. The second button is used as a rest button which when clicked by 
the user the back end code cleans the EditText and allows the user to enter a new time of day.

1.3.	The Back End Code
The back end code is what makes the app work without it the app would have no purpose. The back end code contains all the necessary code that makes the app functional. It is responsible for holding and displaying the information the user wants to see after their input has been made.

1.4.	If … Else Statements
If … else statements played a big role in the back end code as it was important to make the app work. The if … else statements made it possible it allow the use to enter different inputs and the displays different answers depending on what the users in put was.
